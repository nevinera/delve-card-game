# Delve

A dungeon-delving card game, hoping to play like Magic the Dungeoning.


## Components

The base game consists of:

* about 800 ability cards (with no single card repeated more than four times) in 7 power levels
* 60 skill cards, double-sided (requirements and abilities)
* 100 dungeon cards (for the GM to use during play)
* 3 hero tokens
* a few sheets of punch-out monster tokens
* the corresponing monster *cards*, holding stats, abilities, etc.
* Rulebook
* GM book, with a single spread for each of 20 dungeon levels.


For our initial version, the monster tokens will come from the pathfinder punch-outs I already own,
the hero tokens will be colored pawns, and all cards will be hand-created. We will only create the
first three power-levels of cards, because that's all that is used until the rewards from the fourth dungeon.

## Themes

Obviously the main theme is that of 'dungeon delving' - all but one of the players are on a team, trying
to battle their way down through 20 levels of an enormous buried temple of some kind to acquire the MacGuffin Diamond,
which legend says was left on the altar at the bottom. Hordes of undead, dark dwarves, lizardmen, kobolds,
and various other darkness-dwellers stand, live, and snarl between them and their goal, and must be defeated,
or at least gone around.

### Abilities

The system is mythic - there is not only 'magic' in the world, but heroes are capable of unrealistic
feats without magic as well. At the higher power levels, one could certainly throw a fireball using magic,
but one might also have a kick so powerful that the target explodes, or so much discipline that one could
even ignore *having died* for some time.

The abilities are divided among three major spheres, with each containing division into two minor spheres:
the Body sphere splits into Strength and Quickness, the Mind sphere contains Discipline and Arcana,
and the Heart sphere includes Rage and Faith. There is a type of energy for each sphere, and also simple
Energy, which has no sphere at all. Energy from a minor sphere can be spent as itself, as energy from its
corresponding major sphere, or as simple Energy. A hero could have literally any set of cards as his deck
for a given dungeon, but should generally avoid having too many distinct spheres - getting the right type
of energy to play his cards can become difficult.

Characters gain ability cards for several reasons - they start with a significant pool of cards as a group,
they gain cards for completing dungeons (more cards for completing them faster), and most dungeons have
side-quests that could be completed to gain extra cards. From the cards they 'own', each player constructs
his Hero Deck before every dungeon - initially this deck contains 30 cards, but the size goes up occasionally
as the dungeons get larger and more monster-filled.

### Skills

Skills are the other path of development a character climbs along as they play the game - after each level
of dungeon, the hero is allowed to take a new 'skill' card, as long as he satisfies all of the requirements
on that card (those requirements are usually of the form 'at least level X', or 'already has the skill Y').

Before each dungeon, each hero picks the skills that they will be playing with during that dungeon - initially
heroes only get to use two of their skills during a single dungeon, but by level 20 they may use 5. These skills
affect the entire dungeon run - they are in play from the start, and whatever bonuses or effects they provide
will continue until the end of the dungeon.

The skill tree defines 'classes' in a way - you cannot realistically take all of the skills from the top of
the 'Monk' tree and still be able to reach the top of the 'Paladin' tree, for example. There are skills
scattered around that are focused on enabling heroes to have the right Energy to use their major and minor 
spheres consistently, but others are more focused on enabling them to fulfill some role more effectively,
or to use their ability cards more efficiently.

Making all skill setups viable or balanced is not a goal, but any clear skill-tree *path* ought to be equally
playable with some style of ability deck or another. As well, it is expected that players will come up with
ability-skill combinations that are unexpectedly powerful, which will have to be fixed during development.
